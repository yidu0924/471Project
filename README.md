# 471Project

This is the repository for the Math471 project. 

## Project Description
This project is to implement neural networks  to fit a function with a given set of data points. The data points are generated by a function with some noise. The goal is to find the best fitting function that minimizes the error between the predicted values and the actual values. Moreover, we need to compare these two methods.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several folders:

- `data`: Contains the data files used in the project.
- `code`: Contains the Python code used in the project.
- `results`: Contains the results of the project.
- `readme.md`: This file.
